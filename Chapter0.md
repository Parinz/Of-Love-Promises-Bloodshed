"Cortana," John said as he looked around the soft blue hardlight bubble around him. Hearing no response he tried again, "Cortana, do you read?"

His attention was drawn to the blue glow that appeared behind him. As he turned around he saw... *her*. Whatever he was thinking about simply stopped as he watched her walk towards him.

"How?" was all that he managed to say.

"Oh I'm the strangest thing you've seen all day?" Cortana replied with a smile. The smile however, faded quickly as her body tensed up.

*"Something's not right,"* John thought in his mind. To say he was worried would be an understatement. However, just like every time, the mission has to take precedence before his personal feelings. "If we're here..." he continued, waiting for Cortana to finish his sentence.

"It worked. You did it. Just like you always do," she continued, not missing a beat.

"So how do we get out of here?" John asked. Silence filled the air as John noticed Cortana look down-- gathering herself for what she was about to say next.

"I'm not coming with you this t-time," her voice quivered as water seemingly filled her eyes. "Most of me is down there. I only held back enough to get you off the ship," Cortana said sorrowfully.

John felt like he had just been punched in the stomach a million times over. He waited for a laugh that never came. He searched for an answer, a solution, an escape in that beautiful sapphire eyes of hers-- eyes that he would see for the last time. He wanted to tell her how he felt, how she was important to him, how he needed her. "No. That's not--! We go **together,**" was all he managed to say.

She smiled at him in the most heartbreaking way possible and he was sure a part of him died with tat smile. "It's already done," she continued.

*"Maybe there's some way to fix this,"* John thought. "I am not leaving you here!" he said, his voice breaking.

He waited for her to calculate an escape plan, a solution, a remedy-- just anything! "John..." her voice trailed off. She took a step forward, snaked her arms around him, and wrapped him in her embrace. "I've waited so long to do this."

Those words cut his living being into infinite pieces. A long moment of silence passed. "It was *my* job to take care of you," John said solemnly as he reciprocated the embrace with equal intensity.

"We were supposed to take care of each other," she corrected him-- her eyes now staring into his. "And we did."

He felt her embrace tighten for a moment before her arms slid off his back. He reached out for her. "Cortana-- please..." he begged for a final time.

Slowly walking backwards in the most beautiful yet grim way as possible, she uttered the words he swore he would remember for his entire life, "Welcome home, John."

John ran after her as fast as he could. She was within arm's reach! He could still save her! Just when he thought he grabbed her, she vanished into thin air.

A sharp gasp was heard from the Chief's room within the Infinity as he suddenly threw himself off his bed. He took a glance at his watch, it had been exactly 7 months, 20 days, 2 hours, 34 minutes, and 55 seconds since his goodbye with Cortana. His whole body slightly shivered at the thought of her name.

He unfolded his right fist to find Cortana's chip in it. Despite carrying it around with him *everywhere*, memories resurfaced every time he took a glance at it. Every night he would wake up from this dream, full of sweat, and struggling to breathe, and throwing himself off his bed. It had become a routine for him already. 

*"The meds aren't working,"* he thought to himself as he looked towards his nightstand. He requested extensive medication and augmentation-- just anything that would let him *forget*. He took mission after mission nonstop with Blue Team, so much so that the brass ordered him to take leave.

The leave that was supposed to make him feel better was actually making him worst. With combat, Chief could take his mind off of her. With time on his hands however, every thought he had connected to her somehow. He looked towards a star whose soft glow penetrated into his room.

*"I can give you forty-thousand reasons why that sun isn't real. I know it because the emitter's Rayleigh effect is disproportionate to its suggested size. I know because its stellar cycle is more symmetrical than that of an actual star... But for all that, I'll never know if it looks real... If it feels real.

Before this is all over, promise me you'll find out which one of us is the machine.
"*

His head started to throb ever so slightly. But before he knew it, he was already on the ground and wincing in pain. Various memories passed through his mind and yet they weren't his. Even though they looked familiar, they weren't from his perspective. That could only mean one thing.

"C-Cortana?" he asked as he tried to ignore the pain. He felt as if his headache intensified a million times over as voices spoke to him. The voices resembled numerous people who he'd known. They whispered to him one thing, "Genesis."
