"Chief, don't do this to yourself," Lasky said with a worried frown.

"With all due respect Captain, I am fit for duty," Master Chief insisted, his eyes cold yet missing the despair it held just a few days prior.

Captain Thomas Lasky had been at this for 15 minutes now. To the untrained eye the Master Chief seemed to have recovered. To someone like Lasky however, he could tell that something was going on. Lasky noticed the man occasionally zoning out, just staring through the bridge's window to stars with... determination? Hope? Peace? Lasky wasn't sure.

Lasky glanced over to Sarah who was visibly as concerned as he was. During the course of Lasky and Chief's conversation she had dialed ONI about the matter. As she removed her hand from her ears Lasky gestured for her to speak. "How about this Chief? We'll give you a test, if you pass it you are fit for duty, if you don't pass it, you will be taking leave permanently unless we say otherwise," said Sarah as Lasky looked at curiously her.

Chief didn't really have to think. He would give that test a shot if it meant he would get even a microscopic chance of seeing Cortana again. He replied without missing a beat, "Yes Ma'am."

"Good, report to medical wing at 1630 for the test. Dismissed," came Sarah's reply, sighing as soon as Chief left the bridge.

"What are you planning to do?" Tom asked Sarah, clearly resisting the urge to sigh as well.

"ONI wants to provoke his thoughts see if he really has recovered from *her* death," Sarah replied.

"You can't just fully recover from a person's death within 7 months, Sarah. That's the case when the person who died just so happens to be one of the closest thing you've got to a family," Tom argued.

"Look I see it in his eyes too. Something's changed. Maybe those augmentations and medication really forced him to forget," Sarah said feeling a little sad for the Spartan.

Tom contemplated the possible scenarios, before replying, "No. I don't he has forgotten. She was his last anchor to humanity. If you ask me he seems a little more human than he was just a few days prior."

Chief glanced at the time on his wrist watch: 1620. He started making his way to the medical for the test, Spartans were trained to be punctual after all. Despite the fact that he could take a more straightforward route, he decided to go for the more scenic route that would allow him to see the stars. He liked the solitude that the observation deck gave, and the stars reminded him of the fact that Cortana was out there waiting for him.

Lasky's presence broke his reverie. The Chief saluted before greeting him, "Sir."

"Hey Chief," he saluted back, "I had a feeling you'd come through this way. Can we talk for a little while?" Lasky gestured to the railing on the observation deck as Chief walked towards it.

"I won't pretend to know how much she means to you," Chief's body slightly stiffened. "But I noticed that something has changed yesterday, Chief. She's out there isn't she?" Lasky gestured towards the stars, his suspicions confirmed by a slight nod from the Spartan. "Then you'll need this," Lasky said with a soft smile as he handed a folded piece of paper to Chief.

Master Chief unfolded the paper and briefly scanned through its contents, and looked back up. "Thank you, sir," he nodded to Lasky.

"Go bring her back Chief," Lasky said with a smile as he turned around and exited the observation deck.

...

As Master Chief reached the medical wing he was escorted by several ODSTs to what seemed like an interrogation room. Behind the two-way mirror stood Sarah Palmer, Thomas Lasky, and a visual comm link to Admiral Osman. The admiral, with access to the cameras, microphones, as well as Chief's vitals, would be the one deciding whether or not he really was fit for duty.

"Master Chief. My name is Lieutenant Erik Felix, and I will be conducting this test," the ODST said as he sat on a chair across from him. "The rules are simple I will say the name of an object or person and you will will have one second to give me the first word that comes up into your mind. Understand?"

"Yes, sir," Chief replied in a machine-like manner, not hinting at even a tiny ounce of nervousness. The ODST nodded to the mirror.

"UNSC Infinity?"

*Home* "Ship."

"Captain Thomas Lasky?"

*Friend* "Ally."

"Commander Sarah Palmer?"

"Spartan."

"Blue Team?"

"Family."

Then there was a pause before the ODST said the next question, "Cortana?"

*Future* "Past," Master Chief answered as Captain Lasky and Commander Palmer glanced nervously at his vitals. The only noticeable change was the increase of his heartbeat by one bpm before returning back down.

"Flood Gravemind?"

*Kill* "Threat."

"Doctor Catherine Halsey?"

*Mother* "Scientist."

"Rampancy?"

*Death* "Irrelevant."

"Love?"

*Cort--* "Chemicals."

On the other side of the two-way mirror, Lasky and Palmer observed the admiral. Over the course of Chief's answers Tom observed that she had gone from disappointed to surprised. She seemed to contemplate Chief's answers for what seemed like an eternity before finally declaring, "It seems that has he recovered. Very well, he is fit for duty." Then she simply cut the connection.

Tom and Sarah breathed out a breath that they didn't knew they were holding, as they observed the Chief being notified about the test result by the ODST. It was an odd sight, but they both thought the Chief's face lightened up ever so slightly.

After the ODSTs and Chief left the room Sarah punched Tom jokingly. "What did you do Tom?" she asked with a smile.

"I didn't do anything!" he said as he raised his hands in mock defense.

"Of course, O'Captain. It's not like I'm gonna tell the ONI spooks," Sarah said back.

"It was just a piece of paper!" Tom said.

"Uh-huh a piece of paper that just so happens to have all the questions that ODST was about to ask," Sarah suspected.

"Maybe," was all that Tom could say.

"You either just made the worse or the best decision ever... Never change, Tom. Never change," she said as they walked out of the room.
